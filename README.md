SQL Queries

All analytical queries are saved in queries.sql
.
Examples:
```
-- Show first 10 customers
SELECT * FROM customer LIMIT 10;

-- Rentals in 2006, sorted by date
SELECT * FROM rental
WHERE rental_date BETWEEN '2006-01-01' AND '2006-12-31'
ORDER BY rental_date;

-- Average payment amount per customer
SELECT customer_id, AVG(amount) AS avg_payment
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Total rentals per film category
SELECT c.name, COUNT(r.rental_id) AS total_rentals
FROM category c
JOIN film_category fc ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
JOIN film f ON fc.film_id = f.film_id
JOIN inventory i ON f.film_id = i.film_id
JOIN rental r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY total_rentals DESC;
```
